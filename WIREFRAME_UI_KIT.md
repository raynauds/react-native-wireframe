# React Native Wireframe UI Kit

## Purpose

This project aims to create a comprehensive, unstyled, and ready-to-use set of components for rapidly wireframing React Native applications. The components are designed to be easily copy-pasted into any project, providing the basic structure and functionality needed to build out user interfaces quickly.

## Getting Started

To use a component, simply copy its folder from `src/components` into your project. You can then import the component and use it in your code.

## Principles

- **Simplicity**: Components should be as simple as possible, with a minimal API.
- **Unstyled**: Components should be unstyled by default, allowing for easy customization.
- **Independent**: Components should be independent of each other, with no shared dependencies.
- **Ready-to-use**: Components should be ready to be copy-pasted into any project.

## Versioning

This project does not follow a strict versioning scheme. The components are designed to be used as-is, and any breaking changes will be clearly communicated.

## Contributing

To add a new component, please follow these steps:

1.  Create a new folder for the component in `src/components`.
2.  Create a `WComponent.tsx` file with the component's implementation.
3.  Create a `WComponent.stories.tsx` file with the component's stories.
4.  Add the component's stories to `src/app/index.tsx`.
5.  Update this file with the new component's information.
