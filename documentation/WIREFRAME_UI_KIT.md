# React Native Wireframe UI Kit

## Purpose

This project aims to create a comprehensive, unstyled, and ready-to-use set of components for rapidly wireframing React Native applications. The components are designed to be easily copy-pasted into any project, providing the basic structure and functionality needed to build out user interfaces quickly.

## Getting Started

To use a component, simply copy its folder from `packages/react-native-wireframe/src/components` into your project. You can then import the component and use it in your code.

## Principles

- **Simplicity**: Components should be as simple as possible, with a minimal API.
- **Unstyled**: Components should have very basic styling, similar to what is expected in a wireframe.
- **Independent**: Components should not depend on external libraries, make them work in any react native project.
- **Ready-to-use**: Components should be ready to be copy-pasted into any project.
- **Consistency**: New components should follow the same conventions as existing ones. This means accepting a `style` prop for custom styling, supporting accessibility props, and maintaining a consistent approach to layout and API design. Use uniform prop names and structure to ensure components are interchangeable and predictable.

## Versioning

This project does not follow a strict versioning scheme. The components are designed to be used as-is, and any breaking changes will be clearly communicated.

## Contributing

To add a new component, please follow these steps:

1.  Create a new folder for the component in `packages/react-native-wireframe/src/components`.
2.  Create a `WComponent.tsx` file with the component's implementation.
3.  Create a `WComponent.stories.tsx` file with the component's stories in `apps/react-native-wireframe-storybook/src/stories`.
4.  Update this file with the new component's information.
